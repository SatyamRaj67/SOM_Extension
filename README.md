# INFO

This project is a Music Player that has much better UI and animations. With theme support just from a colour.

It offers great customization, and it is API FRIENDLY!!

Everything is loaded from a simple JSON file, which can easily be changed based on whatever you give it.

This also makes it AI friendly, and thus if you want to integrate AI, It can easily be implements

Due to lack of money, I cannot host a server for myself, so you need to deal with it.

# INSTALLATION
This project had pirated content (aka music) so I cannot officially put it on the web stores across the browsers. You will need to..

There are a few steps, but they are quite easy installation. SO INHALEEEEE, EXHALEEE, AND BARE WITH ME. YOU CAN DO THIS!!

## STEP-1: Download the latest Release
Available at [Releases](https://github.com/SatyamRaj67/SOM_Extension/releases)
Download the zip, which has the latest tag on it.

## STEP-3: Go to chrome://extensions
Don't worry, it will automatically take you to your extensions panel

## STEP-6: Choose the folder which was extracted
NOTE:- Make sure, it is not the extracted folder, but the one folder inside it, ELSE, IT WILL GIVE AN ERROR!!

See the image, I am one folder inside, and then there is the main folder.

## STEP-7: Enjoy the extension by pinning it.

Clicking on the extension will open the popup or what I like to call. THE MUSIC CONTROL PANEL.
Enjoy the animations, transitions, and the simple yet convenient UI designs.
